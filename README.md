# NLP Model Automation with Transformers
## Overview
This repository provides scripts and tools to automate multiple NLP models using the Hugging Face transformers library. It includes a comprehensive Jupyter notebook designed for Google Colab to demonstrate the use of various models for different NLP tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, text generation, and more.

### Features
_Automated Scripts_: Easily automate the use of multiple NLP models. <br />
_Hugging Face Transformers_: Utilize state-of-the-art transformer models. <br />
_Colab Demonstration_: A ready-to-use Jupyter notebook for quick demonstrations on Google Colab.<br />
_Customizable_: Modify and extend the scripts for your specific needs.

### NLP Models
This repository includes multiple NLP models to automate different kinds of tasks. The list of Models and their descriptions are described as follows:
#### 1_Machine Translation
Open-source machine translation (MT) models enable translation between different languages without Google Translate. Many models have more than 1000 language pairs to the hugging face hub. 
Three models in our Machine Translation file translate different languages in one direction. These three models are:
